These are my vim configurations.

It is a good starting point for anyone intending to use VIM for development running equally well on Windows, Linux and Mac.

## Installation
See into `install.sh` and you'll hopefully figure out how to install.

YCM might take some time to install. You can choose not to install it by modifying `g:xming_plug_groups` in `vimrc` file.

See `vimrc` for details on my configurations.
